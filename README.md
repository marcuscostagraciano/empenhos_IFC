   `npm i`
2. Run the front-end:

   - Make sure that the python dependencies are installed and in a virtual environment (venv):
     - If you don't have a venv already:  
        `python -m venv [VENV_NAME]`
     - If you have a venv already:
       - Activate the venv (check the 'master' branch for more information);
       - Install the dependencies:  
         `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - With the activated venv and dependencies installed, run the back-end server:  
     `py main.py`
